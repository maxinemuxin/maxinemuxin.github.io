Hi! I am a senior at Harvey Mudd College, joint majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a second major in Cognitive Science at Pomona College.

My research interests focus on three main areas:

(1) Developing neurosymbolic methods and reasoning frameworks/pipelines to improve logical reasoning and agent design.

(2) Understand models' internal representations in reasoning and social tasks.

(3) Comparing cognitive processes in humans and machines to improve LLM mechanisms by drawing insights from human cognition or aligning LLMs with human values.

I am looking for PhD positions starting fall 2025 and research opportunity spring and summer 2025!
