I am a senior at Harvey Mudd College, joint majoring in **Computer Science and Mathematics**, with a second major in **Cognitive Science** at Pomona College.

I am interested in the following research directions:
1. Developing neurosymbolic methods and reasoning frameworks/pipelines to improve logical reasoning and agent design.
2. Understand models' internal representations in reasoning and social tasks.
3. Comparing cognitive processes in humans and machines to improve LLM mechanisms by drawing insights from human cognition or aligning LLMs with human values.

I am currently seeking PhD positions starting Fall 2025 and research opportunities in Spring and Summer 2025!
