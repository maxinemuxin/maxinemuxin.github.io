## Hi, I'm Muxin (Maxine) Liu!

I am a senior at Harvey Mudd College, joint majoring in **Computer Science and Mathematics**, with a second major in **Cognitive Science** at Pomona College.

### Research Interests

1. **Neurosymbolic Methods**: Developing reasoning frameworks and pipelines to improve logical reasoning and agent design.
2. **Internal Representations**: Understanding models' internal representations in reasoning and social tasks.
3. **Cognitive Processes**: Comparing cognitive processes in humans and machines to enhance LLM mechanisms by drawing insights from human cognition or aligning LLMs with human values.

I am currently seeking **PhD positions starting Fall 2025** and **research opportunities in Spring and Summer 2025!**
